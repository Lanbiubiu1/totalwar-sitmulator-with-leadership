# TotalWarSimulator

This repository contains the code for a simulator that resembles battles in the style of [Total War games series](https://www.totalwar.com/).
The main goal of building this simulator is to allow Multi-Agent control algorithms testing in a challenging domain.

You can try the simulator yourself by downloading the build from the latest release.

Feel free to drop me a message for further information.
